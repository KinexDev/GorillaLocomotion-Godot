# Gorilla Locomotion Godot
this is a port of the [gorilla locomotion](https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion) which is the locomotion used in gorilla tag in godot!

# Physics Engine
this locomotion does require jolt physics, default godot physics are way too unstable for this rig, you can use it but its unstable.

#How does it compare?
this locomotion feels way better than miziziz's rig which is what inspired me to make this and very closely imitates the gorilla locomotion
