# Gorilla Locomotion Godot
this is a port of the [gorilla locomotion](https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion) which is the locomotion used in gorilla tag in godot.

# Physics Engine
this locomotion does require jolt physics, default godot physics are way too unstable for this rig, you can use it but its unstable.

# How does it compare?
this locomotion feels way better than [miziziz's rig](https://github.com/Miziziziz/GodotGorillaTagMovement) which is what inspired me to make this and very closely imitates the gorilla locomotion. there are some issues with the locomotion that i could notice but it's nothing that shouldn't be hard to fix.

this project was made in a day because i was bored lol
