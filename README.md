# Gorilla Locomotion Godot
this is a port of the [gorilla locomotion](https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion) which is the locomotion used in gorilla tag to godot.

# Physics Engine
this locomotion does require jolt physics, default godot physics are way too unstable for this rig, you can use it without but it is very unstable.

# How does it compare?
this locomotion feels way better than [miziziz's rig](https://github.com/Miziziziz/GodotGorillaTagMovement) which is what inspired me to make this. The locomotion very closely imitates the gorilla locomotion. There are some issues with the locomotion that i could notice but it's nothing that shouldn't be hard to fix.

# Notes
this project was made in a day because i was bored and haven't used godot in a year (im not a fan of the engine but i just wanted to make this because of my boredom)

you can download the locomotion it by downloading the godot project under this repository

everything is nicely put together, you can get the player using the player_container scene
